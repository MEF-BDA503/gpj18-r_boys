## Proposal of the project

This data set consists of the total population in the provinces and territories throughout Turkey. As a group, we are interested in examining the all data to compare the domestic migration rate  around the country from 2014 to 2017. Therefore, we would like to reach out regional migration impacts and to conclude how migration affected population density in cities.

The goal of this project is for us to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in the class and appyl them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.
